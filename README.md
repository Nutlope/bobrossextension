# Bob Ross Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome Extension that replaces all images on YouTube.com with pictures of Bob Ross when enabled. It's a good "hello world" for Chrome Extensions.

## Usage

60 second video on how to build and use this Chrome Extension is [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB_g4_ptZVc&ab_channel=Nutlope) I'm working on a better video that will be public soon.
